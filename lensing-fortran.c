/* Compute the amplification for an extended source with uniform brightness,
 * using equations (16)-(25) in Agol 2002.  Arguments:
 *   uu  (in)  = distance between source and lens centers, in units of Einstein
 *     radii;
 *   rs  (in)  = source radius, in units of Einstein radii;
 *   rl  (in)  = lens radius, in units of Einstein radii;
 *   amp (out) = amplification of the source.
 *
 * NOTA BENE: this function may not give reliable results when the distance
 * between source and lens is much larger than the source radius **and** the
 * source radius is small (e.g., `uu' is about ten order of magnitudes larger
 * than `rs' and `rs' is of the order of unity or less).  You can workaround
 * this issue by approximating the amplification with the amplification by a
 * point-like lens.
